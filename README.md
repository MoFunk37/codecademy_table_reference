# codecademy_table_reference
A project from Codecademy. The goal is to create a reference sheet for a topic of html or css.
I chose the table element and attributes. We were meant to use css to provide monospace font for code and use custom colours to style the page.
I'm not much of a designer, but I think the premise is met.
